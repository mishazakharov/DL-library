# Deep Learning Library From Scratch

<h2>About</h2>

This project is a tool for creating various kinds of neural networks. All code is written in Python.

The purpose of this project is not to produce as optimized and computationally effective tool as possible.
The main goal of the project is to get some expirience in building libraries and writing deep learning related Python code,
understand everything much better and basically **Learn**.

I repeat, this idea is used **exclusively** for *educational purposes*.
